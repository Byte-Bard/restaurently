Project Title: Restaurently

Description:
Restaurently is a web-based application that simplifies the process of finding the best-rated restaurants and exclusive deals in your area. Leveraging data from popular food delivery platforms like Swiggy and Zomato, Restaurently aggregates restaurant information and presents it in an easily navigable format on its website.

The project's main highlight is the utilization of web scraping techniques, specifically BeautifulSoup in Python, to extract and organize data from Swiggy and Zomato. This automation ensures that users can access up-to-date and relevant information without the need to visit multiple platforms individually.

Key features of Restaurently include:

Restaurant Ratings: Users can quickly compare restaurant ratings and reviews from multiple sources to make informed dining decisions.
Exclusive Deals: Restaurently provides access to exclusive deals and promotions available at various restaurants.
Booking Functionality: Users have the convenience of booking a table directly through the website, streamlining the reservation process.
Restaurently not only simplifies restaurant selection but also enhances the overall dining experience, making it a valuable tool for food enthusiasts and diners seeking quality dining options and savings.
